## Who I Work With

### Small Enterprise

Whatever your business, if you use data to make decisions, you need to ensure
your data pipelines are reliable, your data quality is known, and that any
analytics or data science efforts are based in tangible business questions and
implemented using appropriate tools. My previous projects cover the spectrum of
business intelligence, from defining and reporting KPIs to deal forecasting and
lead prioritization to designing matching engines. I am prepared to tackle any
data-related issue you may have, from establishing robust ingestion processes
to automating training and use of predictive models, and providing real-time
alerts to their performance. I am also versed in writing requirements and
user stories should the implementation need to be handed off.

Since 2019 I have had extensive experience with AWS, Snowflake, several
relational databases, Salesforce, Tableau, and an assortment of data science
packages. I have worked in several startup environments, and I am especially
interested in helping to establish your data science/data engineering practice
or to improve processes for your growing team.

### Researchers

As a researcher or analyst, you need to be sure your conclusions are sound and
supported by data. The best way to do this is to involve a statistician. As a
statistical collaborator, I want to ensure that researchers and the public
make responsible use of data. I can provide guidance at every stage, from
proposal writing and designing experiments, to data collection and validation,
all the way to the final data analysis and ensuring results are communicated
in an understandable manner.

I have been collaborating with scientific and academic researchers since 2016,
contributing to projects ranging from health surveys to animal behavior
experiments. Additionally, I did my own graduate research in the statistical
mapping of unexploded ordnance at weapons testing sites.
