title: "Thoughts on Data Engingeering"
---


In grad school I worked in a strictly academic sense, where I was provided with
a specific dataset from a thoughtful study design with some interesting
characteristics and tasked with defining a probabilistic process that could
have generated such data. The most exciting challenge was where the dataset
presented some hierarchical data requiring a novel way to rectify them. After
working at data science startups for over four years, I appreciate the
disconnected. "Real-world" data (i.e. not from some intentionally-designed
study) require considerably more time and thought designing systems to get the
various datastores/lakes/warehouses to communicate replicably, the results
typically barely suitable for a fundamental statistical method them for
buzzworkds like "AI/ML" or "deep learning", let alone "generative models". Our
"data science" education should emphasize less and the fancier sides of
statistics than to do rigorously do the data-related software engineering that
underlies data science in industry.
