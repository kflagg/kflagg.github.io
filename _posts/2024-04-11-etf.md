title: "Predictability Of A Volatility-Leveraged ETF"
---

The rise in internet-based retail stock trading has spawned a great deal
of online discussion about various securities and trading strategies. My
contribution here consists of some observations I have had about one
particular exchange-traded fund (ETF).

ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF
([UVXY](https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/strategic/uvxy)) is a
volatility-based fund that is balanced to gain value quickly in times of
short-term volatility in the S&P 500.

Two casual observations inspired this data analysis:

1.  Within a single day, UVXY tends to perform inversely to the overall
    stock market.
2.  Over the long term, UVXY’s value closely follows an exponential
    decay.

decay curve.]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/etf/uvxyraw.png)

The decay appears clearly when the values over the last three years are
plotted, but the plot also shows occasional large spikes upward. I set
out to compare UVXY to several other funds with the goal of identifying
signals that could forecast whether UVXY will increase or decrease in
value each day. I focus on simple indicators based on the relative
performance of these funds on the same day and the previous day, and on
these two outcomes:

1.  UVXY closing value relative to the previous day’s closing value
2.  UVXY closing value relative to the opening value

## Study Design

I downloaded daily candle data (Open, High, Low, Close) for all trading
days from April 1, 2021, through March 31, 2024, from [Yahoo!
Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/). I included UVXY and:

-   ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), invests in Bitcoin futures
    and meant to resemble the performance of Bitcoin (launched October
    2021)
-   ProShares Ultra QQQ ETF (QLD), an equity-based fund
-   ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ ETF (SQQQ), an inverse-equity fund
-   ProShares UltraPro QQQ ETF (TQQQ), an equity-based fund
-   ProShares UltraPro DOW30 ETF (UDOW), invests in blue-chip US
    companies
-   ProShares UltraPro S&P500 ETF (UPRO), invests in large-cap US
    companies
-   Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX), meant to track the S&P 500

There are two footnotes regarding the data:

1.  Candles for BITO are available only back to October 20, 2021.
2.  FXAIX is not an ETF, so only a single daily value is available
    rather than a full candle. I labeled this as the Close value.

The following figure shows the trends in closing values since April 2021.
The values are normalized so that the end of March 2024 is 100%.

and SQQQ generally decay over time and FXAIX is very stable. The others move
up and down together. The values are normalized to be 100% at the end of
March 2024.]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/etf/alllog.png)

The focus of the analysis is on single-day trends, so I used relative
values. I defined relative values as each candle value divided by the
previous closing value. I also captured within-day variation as High /
Low and within day trend as Close / Open.

## Analysis

UVXY is more likely than not to lose value on a scale of a day or
larger, with a median Close / Open ratio of 99.1%, a median Close /
Previous Close ratio of 98.7%, and a median Open / Previous Close ratio
of 99.5%. However, UVXY has the largest variation of the funds included
in this analysis, with a median High / Low ratio of 106.4%. It also
exceeded the previous closing value on a majority of days, with a median
High / Previous Close ratio of 102.4%.

To compare across the different funds, I computed the [Kendall
correlations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient)
among the various indicators. The UVXY indicators are moderately
positively correlated with the same-day SQQQ indicators (this is the
other fund designed to gain value in times of short-term volatility),
weakly negatively correlated with the same-day BITO indicators, and
moderately negatively correlated with the other same-day indicators.

The outcomes of primary interest (UVXY Relative Close and Close / Open)
appear largely uncorrelated with all of the previous-day indicators. In
contrast, UVXY Relative High and Relative Low do have weak correlations
with the previous-day indicators. Relative High is very weakly positively
correlated with some of the UVXY and SQQQ previous-day indicators, and
very weakly negatively correlated with most other previous-day indicators
except those for BITO. Relative low has the same relationships but in
the opposite direction.

## Discusison

Regarding the primary goal of identifying signals that could predict if
UVXY will close higher than it opened, or higher than it closed on the
previous trading day, this analysis is inconclusive. I showed that UVXY
has unsurprising correlations with the values of other funds on the same
day, but without an association with any previous-day indicators, or a
stronger association with Relative Open, there is not much actionability
in these findings.

This analysis does raise some questions worthy of follow-up analysis.
The high within-day variation of UVXY, and the large chance that, at
some point throughout each day, it will exceed the previous closing
value even though it tends to trend down (recall the median Relative
High of 102.4%) make this ETF appealing for day trading. A further
analysis at a resolution finer than daily could help develop strategies
for frequent trading. This could help illuminate the correlations of
Relative High and Relative Low with the previous-day indicators, to
address whether that was a spurious finding, or if the magnitude or
timing of the high/low could be predictable.
