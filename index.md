## About Me

When not doing statistics or data science, I am often traveling or doing swing
and Latin dancing. However, this site is mostly about my professional
activities. Take a look at my [CV](kflagg-cv)

I care deeply about the next generation of data practitioners with the
knowledge they need to succeed. There were a lot of things I needed to learn
or develop on my own throughout my education and career, so I have put together
some [resources](computing) to get stats/DS students started with computing
tools and methods.


## INLA

Here are some assorted vignettes and slide decks from my doctoral research
applying the integrated nested Laplace transform to spacial point patterns.
