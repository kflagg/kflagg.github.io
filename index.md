When not doing statistics or data science, I am often traveling or doing swing
and Latin dancing. However, this site is mostly about my professional
activities. Take a look at my [CV](kflagg-cv)

I care deeply about empowering the next generation of data practitioners with
the knowledge they need to succeed. There were a lot of things I learned or
developed on my own throughout my education and career, so I have put together
some [resources](computing) to get stats/DS students started with computing
tools and methods.

Since completing my degree, I have been working in industry and not actively
participating in academic research. This website exists to support those who
may want to build upon my work.
