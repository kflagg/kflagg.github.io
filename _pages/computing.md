I put in a lot of effort to learn the tools I use, and I want to make it
easier for the next generation.


## Python

While working in business data science, I had to migrate from R to Python. I
have an ongoing side project to create a curriculum for people with statistical
training to learn to do data analysis in Python.

- [Python curriculum](https://kflagg.gitbook.io/pythonds/) **(work in progress)**


## R

- Tutorial on [fitting spatial LGCP models](https://github.com/kflagg/jas-inla-review)
  with R-INLA and a finite element (SPDE) approximation.
  - [Example code](https://github.com/kflagg/jas-inla-review)
- [PoisDPMix](https://github.com/kflagg/poisDPmix), an R package for fitting
  infinite mixtures of Gaussians to partially-observed spatial point pattern
  data.
  - The code and documentation are in a poor state as I do not expect this to
    be useful to anyone, but if you want to use it please let me know!
