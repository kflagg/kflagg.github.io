Welcome! I am a statistics and data science consultant, currently currently
taking on [consulting projects](consulting). I have broad experience in both
scientific research and the tech sector and I am especially interested in
helping small or growing teams establish repeatable processes and complete
their analyses.

When not working with data, I am often traveling or doing swing and Latin
dancing. However, this site is mostly about my professional activities.
See the links in the sidebar for other things I do.

I care deeply about empowering the next generation of data practitioners with
the knowledge they need to succeed. There were a lot of things I learned or
developed on my own throughout my education and career, so I have put together
some [resources](computing) to get stats/DS students started with computing
tools and methods.

Since completing my degree, I have primarily worked in industry and not been
actively participating in academic research. A [section](research) of this
website exists to support those who want to build upon my past academic work.
I am an alumnus of Bozeman Environmental and Ecological Statistics; you can
find more about their current research at
[the BEES website](https://bozemanenvrstat.github.io).
