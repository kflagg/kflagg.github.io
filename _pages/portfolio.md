# Data Consulting

## Analysis of an Electric Fence Permeability Experiment

- Client: Brittani Johnson
- Project Type: [MS thesis](https://scholarworks.montana.edu/handle/1/14687)
- Capacity: graduate assistant consultant at [MSU SCRS](https://www.montana.edu/statisticalconsulting)

### Project Summary

The client, a master's student in the Department of Animal and Range Sciences
at Montana State University, had conducted an experiment regarding selective
permeability of electric fences to grizzly bears. The objective was to assess
which of two fence designs was better at preventing passage when powered on,
while also not impeding the natural movements of bears throughout their habitat
when powered off. Triangular enclosures of either fence design were set up at
locations around the Blackfoot Valley in western Montana. Bait was placed at
the center of each enclosure. The fencers were alternately powered on for
several days and powered off for several days while trail cameras filmed
interactions between grizzly bears and the fences.

### Services Provided

- Provided recommendations on model/method selection.
    - The initial recommendation was to use generalized estimating equations
      (GEEs) to implement logistic regression to estimate the probability of
      bear passage, but this was not possible because of small success counts
      at some locations.
    - Several nonparametric contingency table hypothesis tests were used
      instead.
- Carried out the analysis in R.
- Computed binomial confidence intervals and generated plots summarizing the
  data.


## Analysis of Food Security Survey Data

- Client: Erin Smith
- Project Type: [peer-reviewed research paper](https://doi.org/10.5304/jafscd.2019.09B.011)
- Capacity: graduate assistant consultant at [MSU SCRS](https://www.montana.edu/statisticalconsulting)

### Project Summary

The client, a master's student in the Department of Health and Human Development
at Montana State University, had conducted a survey where residents of the
Flathead Indian Reservation in western Montana provided interviews and responded
to a questionnaire regarding their food security, their use of wild foods, and
their identities as Native Americans. The objective was to assess the impact of
hunting and gathering on both food security and cultural identity in relation
to climate change.

### Services Provided

- Provided guidance on model/method selection and implementation in JMP.
- Recommended wording to explain the statistical methods and results.
- Copyedited the manuscript.
