title: "How Do Online Reviews Affect Web Traffic?"
---


I have been working with a small business owner who recently purchased and
rebranded a restaurant. The new re-launched restaurant has an upscale menu of
a cuisine that is uncommon in the area, and a selection of exclusive wines. The
business also hosts special events, live music, and dancing.

We have been focussed on SEO strategy and the general online presence.
Specifically, we began to wonder how the restaurant's first negative review
might affect web traffic.

Whenever there is a uncertainty, it is valuable to assess available data. Here
is the quick analysis I did.


## Approach

There is no clear hypothesis to test, so the most appropriate course of action
is to visualize and/or summarize relevant data. We can then potentially develop
hypotheses or KPIs to investigate using future data.

My approach was simply to combine several relevant datasets, align them over
time, and visually look for patterns. Smoothing is an option, but I have enough
experience that I can generally identify patterns without them and I prefer to
see the variability of the raw data.

Data were obtained for the time from website launch (May 25) through
September 20. I combined the following datasets:

<script style="text/javascript">
function toggleFootnote(id){
  if(document.getElementById(id).style.display == 'none'){
    document.getElementById(id).style.display = 'inline'
  }else{
    document.getElementById(id).style.display = 'none'
  }
}
</script>

- Daily website visits from Squarespace
- Daily search clicks from Google Search Console
  - I included the totals as well as the clicks for each search term that had at
    least 5 clicks in the entire time period
  - Most of the search terms included the name of the business; I have
    anonymized these for public posting
- Review scores and dates from
  Google<a onclick="toggleFootnote('gfootnote')">\*</a>, Tripadvisor, and Yelp
  - I also pulled out some keywords from the review text and anonymized these
- I created an "events" dataset to represent two notable events: a newspaper
  feature on June 6 and a special event featuring a well-known guest chef on
  August 18

I then plotted these over time on a Tableau dashboard.

<i id="gfootnote" style="{display:none}">
Note: Google only reports review dates as "\_\_ days/weeks/months ago". I
cross-referenced the reviews to other sites where possible (i.e. looked for an
identical review or another review obviously from the same person around the
same time) to impute dates. Where this was not possible, I subtracted the
stated time interval from the date of data collection (September 20).
Therefore the earlier Google review dates are approximate and the reviews may
actually be older than the reported date.
