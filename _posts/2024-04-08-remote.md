title: "Why I Work Remotely"
---

In short, it helps me balance.

I primarily work from my home base in Bozeman, MT, but I gain much inspiration
from the flexibility to travel and grow my hobbies. I may string together
several weekend trips with neither a reason to return home nor a reason to
take several weeks off for the entire duration. My portable office setup fits
in a single suitcase and allows me to work from cafes, friends' homes, or
anyplace my mobile hotspot allows. With modern collaboration tools such as
Tandem, Slack, Google Meet, and Teams, there simply is no technical reason to
require everyone to be in the same location (or even time zone) at all times.
And even a good VPN or remote desktop can bypass data security reasons.

And, of course, I aspire to one day acquire a van with a minimal but
more-permanent office setup (think Lincoln Lawyer but much lower-key).
