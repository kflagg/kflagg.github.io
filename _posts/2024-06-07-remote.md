title: "Why I Work Remotely"
---

In short, it helps me balance.

I primarily work from my home base in Bozeman, MT, but I gain much inspiration
from the flexibility to travel and grow my hobbies. I may string together
several weekend trips with neither a reason to return home nor a reason to
take several weeks off for the entire duration. My portable office setup fits
in a single suitcase and allows me to work from cafes, friends' homes, or
any place my mobile hotspot allows.

With modern collaboration tools such as Tandem, Slack, Google Meet, and Teams,
there simply is no technical reason to require everyone to be in the same
location (or even time zone) at all times. And even a good VPN or remote
desktop can bypass data security reasons.

<script style="text/javascript">
// Set filenames and captions.
var filenames = ["park.jpg", "focusnye.jpg", "nyc", "millelacs.jpg"];
var captions = [
  "Coding in the park on a beautiful Montana day.",
  "Ringing in the new year at Lindy Focus in Asheville, NC. I spent a week working from a hotel suite during the day and dancing all night!",
  "Exploring NYC. I worked from my friend's apartment and enjoyed getting to know new nightlife.",
  "Camping at Mille Lacs, MN. This trip included both a week of actual time off for a family ruinion and another week working from a friend's house."
];

// Index of the displayed image and caption.
var idx = 0;

// Functions to update the image and caption.
function updateImage(){
  document.getElementById("galleryimage").src = "{../assets/" + filenames[idx]
  document.getElementById("gallerycaption").innerText = captions[idx]
}
function prevImage(){
  if(idx > 0){
    idx--;
  } else {
    idx = filenames.length - 1
  }
  updateImage();
}
function nextImage(){
  if(idx < filenames.length - 1
    idx++;
  } else {
    idx = 0
  }
  updateImage();
}
</script>
<button name="previmage" id="previmage" onclick="prevImage()">&larr;</button>
<img id="galleryimage" src="" alt="" />
<p id="gallerycaption"></p>
<button name="nextimage" id="nextimage" onclick="nextImage()">&rarr;</button>
<script style="text/javascript">
updateImage();
</script>

Working while traveling does not decrease my productivity. If anything, it
increases it. For me, fresh experiences&mdash;taken in moderation, and when
my workload and funload are both in balance&mdash;provide inspiration and
creativity to approach my work with new ideas and renewed motivation.

I do not mean to overstate how much travelling I do. Working from the road is
a perk that I love, but much of the time, I am simply most comfortable working
from the familiar surroundings of my home.

These are my preferences; I understand that others have different reasons for
working remotely or have great reasons for preferring to work onsite. I have
spent quite a bit of time discovering how to balance my priorities of work,
travel, and hobbies. I understand the difference between working nomadically
and taking a vacation, and I know that sometimes I must focus on work and will
not be doing extracuriculars regardless of my location. I live in the 21st
century, where the office need not be in a single location.
