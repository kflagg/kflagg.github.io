# Data Consulting

## Analysis of an Electric Fence Permeability Experiment

- Client: Brittani Johnson
- Project Type: [MS thesis](https://scholarworks.montana.edu/handle/1/14687)
- Capacity: graduate assistant consultant at [MSU SCRS](https://www.montana.edu/statisticalconsulting)

### Project Summary

The client, a master's student in the Department of Animal and Range Sciences
at Montana State University, had conducted an experiment regarding selective
permeability of electric fences to grizzly bears. The objective was to assess
which of two fence designs was better at preventing passage when powered on,
while also not impeding the natural movements of bears throughout their habitat
when powered off. Triangular enclosures of either fence design were set up at
locations around the Blackfoot Valley in western Montana. Bait was placed at
the center of each enclosure. The fencers were alternately powered on for
several days and powered off for several days while trail cameras filmed
interactions between grizzly bears and the fences.

### Services Provided

- Provided recommendations on model/method selection.
    - The initial recommendation was to use generalized estimating equations
      (GEEs) to implement logistic regression to estimate the probability of
      bear passage, but this was not possible because of small success counts
      at some locations.
    - Several nonparametric hypothesis tests for multidimensional contingency
      tables were used instead.
- Carried out the analysis in R.
- Computed binomial confidence intervals and generated plots summarizing the
  data.


## Analysis of an Advance Directives Completion Intervention

- Client: Christine Fanelli
- Project Type: [DNP capstone project](https://scholarworks.montana.edu/handle/1/12777)
- Capacity: graduate assistant consultant at [MSU SCRS](https://www.montana.edu/statisticalconsulting)

### Project Summary

The client, a doctor of nursing practice student in the College of Nursing at
Montana State University, had conducted a survey about knowledge of advance
directives among patients aged 65 and older at a family practice clinic in rural
southwestern Montana. The client also implemented an intervention where those
patients were provided with educational materials about advance directives
during their clinic visits. The survey was conducted both before and after the
intervention, and the objective was to assess if the intervention was associated
with greater rates of patients having advance directives.

### Services Provided

- Provided recommendations on model/method selection. A logistic regression
  model was used.
- Carried out analysis in R.
- Generated plots summarizing the data.
- Recommended wording to explain the statistical methods and results.


## Analysis of an Mental Health Stigma Survey

- Client: Sarah Keller
- Project Type: [internal report](https://scholarworks.montana.edu/handle/1/14927)
  upon which the client based several talks and posters

### Project Summary

The client, a professor Department of Communication and Theatre at Montana
State University, Billings, had conducted an experiment to assess if an online
video-based intervention could reduce stigma around discussing suicide and
mental health among college students at a university in Montana. Participants
were assigned to one of two treatment groups or to a control group, and
completed a questionnaire before viewing a video and then again two weeks
later. The videos viewed by the treatment groups were based upon a theatre
program in which local high school and college students discussed their
experiences with depression and suicidal ideation, and the questionnaire
included the Self-Stigma of Seeking Help survey instrument.

### Services Provided

- Provided recommendations on model/method selection. A linear regression
  model was used.
- Conducted psychometric evaluation of the survey instruments.
- Carried out analysis in R.
- Generated plots summarizing the data.
- Recommended wording to explain the statistical methods and results.


## Analysis of Food Security Survey Data

- Client: Erin Smith
- Project Type: [peer-reviewed research paper](https://doi.org/10.5304/jafscd.2019.09B.011)
- Capacity: graduate assistant consultant at [MSU SCRS](https://www.montana.edu/statisticalconsulting)

### Project Summary

The client, a master's student in the Department of Health and Human Development
at Montana State University, had conducted a survey where residents of the
Flathead Indian Reservation in western Montana provided interviews and responded
to a questionnaire regarding their food security, their use of wild foods, and
their identities as Native Americans. The objective was to assess the impact of
hunting and gathering on both food security and cultural identity in relation
to climate change.

### Services Provided

- Provided guidance on model/method selection and implementation in JMP.
- Recommended wording to explain the statistical methods and results.
- Copyedited the manuscript.
