## About Me

When not doing statistics or data science, I am often traveling or doing swing
and Latin dancing. However, this site is mostly about my professional
activities. Take a look at my [CV](kflagg-cv)

I care deeply about the next generation of data practitioners with the
knowledge they need to succeed. There were a lot of things I needed to learn
or develop on my own throughout my education and career, so I have put together
some [resources](computing) to get stats/DS students started with computing
tools and methods.

Since completing my degree, I have been working in industry and not actively
participating in academic research. This website exists to support those who
may want to build upon my work.


## Mapping Spatial Point Process Intensity

My [dissertation](https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/16040) is
about models and sampling designs for mapping point intensity across space
when only events in swathes along a path are observed. Some additional
resources are:
- Chapter 2: [PoisDPMix](https://github.com/kflagg/poisDPmix) R package
- Chapter 3: [Example code](https://github.com/kflagg/jas-inla-review) for fitting LGCP models in R
- Chapter 4: [Data visualization gallery](manuscript2/graphics)
  - I created that from scratch in JavaScript!

## INLA

Here are some assorted vignettes and slide decks from my doctoral research
applying the integrated nested Laplace transform to spacial point patterns.

- [Example code from my INLA tutorial](https://github.com/kflagg/jas-inla-review)
- [INLA demo slides](manuscript2/presentations/inlademo.html)
- [INLA spatial prediction vignette](manuscript2/vignettes/prediction.html)
- [Three Minute Thesis slides](flagg-3min.html)
