<h1>Python For Data Analysts</h1>

<p>
Welcome! This is a set of notes and links to tutorials that I have curated as
part of my journey in learning Python. I am sharing these with the intent of
guiding others through a crash course in using Python for data analysus. The
target audience consists of [1] data scientists with experience using other
languages (e.g. Matlab or R) and [2] people with some technical knowledge who
want to collaborate more effectively with data scientists (e.g. scientists and
business analytics professionals). My approach is a pragmatic introduction to
Python modules useful for data analysis, and is light on the computer science
and statististics/data science theory.
