When not doing statistics or data science, I am often traveling or doing swing
and Latin dancing. However, this site is mostly about my professional
activities. Take a look at my [CV](kflagg-cv).

I care deeply about empowering the next generation of data practitioners with
the knowledge they need to succeed. There were a lot of things I learned or
developed on my own throughout my education and career, so I have put together
some [resources](computing) to get stats/DS students started with computing
tools and methods.

Since completing my degree, I have been working in industry and not actively
participating in academic research. This website exists primarily to support
those who want to build upon my past academic work. I am an alumnus of
Bozeman Environmental and Ecological Statistics; you can find more about the
current research at [the BEES website](https://bozemanenvrstat.github.io).
