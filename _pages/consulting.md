As a researcher, you need to be sure your conclusions are sound and supported
by data. The best way to do this is to involve a statistician. As a statistical
collaborator, I want to ensure that researchers and the public make responsible
use of data. I can provide guidance at every stage, from proposal writing and
designing experiments, to data collection and validation, all the way to the
final data analysis and ensuring results are communicated in an understandable
manner.

I have been collaborating with scientific and academic researchers since 2016,
contributing to projects ranging from health surveys to animal behavior
experiments. I also did graduate research in the statistical mapping of
unexploded ordnance at weapons testing sites. Additionally, I have extensive
experience with cloud computing and enterprise-scale databases, so I am
prepared to tackle any data-related issue you may have, from establishing
robust ingestion processes to automating training and use of predictive models,
and providing real-time alerts to their performance.

If you are interested in bringing me onto your project as a statistical
practitioner, I will be happy to schedule a free no-obligation 45-minute
consultation to discuss your needs. [Email me](mailto:flagg.ka@gmail.com) to
get started!
