title: "Mapping Spatial Point Process Intensity"
---


My [dissertation](https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/16040) is
about models and sampling designs for mapping point intensity across space
when only events in swathes along a path are observed. Some additional
resources are:
- Chapter 2: [PoisDPMix](https://github.com/kflagg/poisDPmix) R package
- Chapter 3: [Example code](https://github.com/kflagg/jas-inla-review) for fitting LGCP models in R
- Chapter 4: [Data visualization gallery](manuscript2/graphics)
  - I created that from scratch in JavaScript!
