Welcome! I am a freelance statistics and data science consultant, currently
currently taking on [consulting collaborators](consulting).

When not working with data, I am often traveling or doing swing and Latin
dancing. However, this site is mostly about my professional activities.

I care deeply about empowering the next generation of data practitioners with
the knowledge they need to succeed. There were a lot of things I learned or
developed on my own throughout my education and career, so I have put together
some [resources](computing) to get stats/DS students started with computing
tools and methods.

Since completing my degree, I have primarily worked in industry and not been
actively participating in academic research. Sections of this website exist to
support those who want to build upon my past academic work. I am an alumnus of
Bozeman Environmental and Ecological Statistics; you can find more about their
current research at [the BEES website](https://bozemanenvrstat.github.io).
